This todo app I created using React Library with JSON server API and axios.
There are implementation of GRUD methods (async).
API calls made with axios.
FontAwesome icons are used.

Our main state(data) is on mock remote server.
All logic is in separated components (newTodo-add and TodoItem-change/delete) and the state(data) is in Parent component and shares it via props to its children(NewTodoSection and ToDoItem)

No struggles at all during creating this app. Used my axios notes as a template.
